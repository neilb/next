Revision history for Perl extension NEXT.pm

0.69 2022-01-19 NEILB
    - Removed dependency on mro. PR#5 from HAARG++.
    - Only install in perl dirs on older perls with bad load order
      PR#6 from HAARG++.

0.68 2021-04-19 NEILB
    - Fix for RT#123002, so NEXT works with proxy constants
    - Made testsuite clean under strict & warnings
    - Made testsuite pass if running under perls that are already c3.

0.67_03 2021-04-18 NEILB
    - mro was added in Perl 5.9.5, and it's not dual-life, so Reini's
      patch (in 0.67_01) failed on earlier versions of Perl.
      Have now made its use dependent on version, with "use if".

0.67_02 2021-04-18 NEILB
    - Applied patch from Father C so that NEXT works with proxy constants.
      RT#123002

0.67_01 2021-04-18 NEILB
    - Enforced strict and warnings on testsuite. Thanks to ATOOMIC.
    - Added github CI. Thanks to ATOOMIC.
    - @ISA fixes for c3, so tests will pass on perls that use c3 as default
      (for example cperl). Thanks to RURBAN.

0.67 2016-07-30 NEILB
    - Changed class names in SYNOPSIS from A, B, C, D to P, Q, R, S.
      This is avoid potential clash with core B:: namespace. RT#9734
      I didn't change the later examples in the doc, as I think they're ok.
    - Added mentions of next::method in the core "mro" module.
    - Changed all mentions of "NEXT.pm" in the doc to C<NEXT>.

0.66 2016-07-28 NEILB
    - split the "package EVERY" statement across two lines to hide it
      from PAUSE and help with resolving a permissions conflict with "Every".
    - Added prereqs, license type, and min perl version to dist metadata
    - Added github repo to dist metadata
    - Fixed pod error reported in RT#49984 and RT#100587,
      and rogue trailing spaces in pod, RT#64923

      NEXT is core (Jerry D. Hedden).

0.62    Wed Apr  8 03:27:25 2009
    - Be less aggressive when looking at the symbol table to find
      methods. This prevents "used only once" warnings on 5.10.

    - Fix a bug when using NEXT from within an eval block (Dave Rolsky).
